<h1>Spatial B-trees<h1>
</center>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree">B-tree</a> is an awesome
    data structure. 
    
    Its primary purpose is to maintain an
    ordered list of items, where each operation (insert, delete, search) is
    guaranteed a time complexity of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">O(log n)</a>.
    The B-tree pretty ubiquitous and a foundational structure in many of the most popular
    database software, such as Postgres, Sqlite, Mysql, etc.
</p>

<p>
    This document describes a new way to extend an existing B-tree for the use of 
    multidimensional data.
</p>

<p>
    Currently there's a bunch of existing structures that can be used for spatial
    data, such as the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree">R-tree</a>, 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree">K-d tree</a>, 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree">Quadtree</a>, and 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UB-tree">UB-tree</a>.
</p>

<p>
    This one is a different.
</p>

<h2>The Algorithm</h2>

<p>
A standard B-tree is an ordered tree-based data structure that stores its items
in nodes.
</p>
<p>
The B-tree has a single root node, which may have children nodes, and those 
children nodes may also have children nodes.

</pre>

<p>
The only change is that we will now store bounding box information for each 
child. This bounding box will be expanded to include all children nodes and
the current branch level item.
</p>

<p>
For example, here we use a blue box to represent the branch level boxes.

<h2>Operations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Insert: Same algorithm as the orginal B-tree. Except now
each bounding box, from leaf to root, will be expanded to make room for
the new item.
<li>Delete: Also the same as the original, with adjustments from leaf to root.
<li>Spatial search: This works like an R-tree, where you scan each retangle
(bounding box) and take intersecting children.
</ul>

<a name="key-order"></a>
<h2>Key Order</h2>

<p>
The Spatial B-tree leaves the order of the items up to you. 
This means the quality and performance of searching the tree can vary greatly
by the how this ordering is managed.
</p>

<p>
For example, let's say you want to store geospatial points where each points
is a tuple that contains at least three fields (id,lat,lon). Normally you 
would order on 'id', but this may lead to subpar performance because the 'id'
may not necessarily correspond with the (lat,lon). This will potentially leave
points that are spatally far apart, nearby in the B-tree; and points that are
spatially close, far apart in the B-tree.
</p>

<p>
Ideally, for best performance you would use a space-filling curve algorithm, 
such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve">Hilbert curve</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-order_curve">Z-order curve</a>, to 
produce a curve value that would be stored along with the 'id'. So your tuple
will look more like (curve,id,lat,lon), where the Spatial B-tree orders on 
(curve,id).
</p>






<h2>Comparison</h2>

<p>
Structurally the Spatial B-tree is like the 
<a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/algorithms/cbtree.html">Counted B-tree</a>, 
but functionally it similar to the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree">R-tree</a> and the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UB-tree">UB-tree</a>.
</p>

<h3>R-tree</h3>
<p>
It's like an R-tree, each child rectangle is the minimum bounding
rectangle of the entire child tree.
</p>

<p>
A difference is that the R-tree stores all items at the leaf level, just 
like a B+Tree. While the Spatial B-tree stores items in the branches and leaves,
just like a standard B-tree.
</p>

<p>
Another difference is that during insertion the R-tree and it's variants, such
as the R*tree, go to great lengths to determine the best ordering of the branch
rectangles and items. Whenever a new item is inserted into an R-tree, from root
to leaf, a complicated algorithm is used to choose the best child node to insert 
the item into. Depending the quality of that algorithm, which isn't always 
identical with every implementations, the performance of inserting and
searching can vary greatly.
</p>

<p>
The Spatial B-tree on the otherhand inserts items exactly like a standard
B-tree, by ordering on the item's key. As <a href="#key-order">stated above</a>,
this means that you must choose your keys wisely.
<p>

<p>
One R-tree variant worth noting is the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_R-tree">Hilbert R-tree</a>, which 
stores items in linear order using a Hilbert curve. This provides excellent 
search performance compared to other R-trees, and its ordering of items is very 
similar to a Spatial B-tree using a Hilbert curve in its key. But the 
structure is a bit more complicated that a traditional R-tree, it must 
track both LHVs (Largest Hilbert Value) and MBRs (Minimum Bounding Rectangle) 
for leaves and branches. This leads to extra work to maintain. And insertions
and deletions are generally less efficent than a Spatial B-tree.
</p>


<h3>UB-tree</h3>
<p>
It's similar to a UB-tree because both the Spatial B-tree and UB-tree both
will store the items linearly based on the key. 
</p>

<p>
Just like the R-tree, the UB-tree stores all items in the leaves, while the 
Spatial B-tree stores items in branches and leaves, like a standard B-tree.
</p>

<p>
Another difference is that the UB-tree is designed to order on a Z-order curve, 
while the Spatial B-tree doesn't care, leaving it up to you what the ordering 
is. This opens up the Spatial B-tree to different strategies, such as Z-order 
or Hilbert or something else.
</p>

<p>
Also the UB-tree does not store the MBRs (Minimum Bounding Rectangle) and
thus cannot scan the tree for intersections like an R-tree and Spatial B-tree.
Instead it needs to use an algorithm, called GetNextZ, which basically looks
at ranges of the Z-curve to find nearby nodes that overlap a target area.
Effectivally working like something between a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree">Quadtree</a> search and a 
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=concepts-geohashes-geohash-covers">Geohash covers</a>
algorithm.
</p>

<p>
In general the Spatial B-tree is designed to search like an Hilbert R-tree 
but have the simplicity of a standard B-tree.
<p>

<p>
One more thing, the Spatial B-tree and UB-tree guarantee stable ordering 
of items. This means that no matter what the order of inserts and deletes of a 
set of items is, those items will always be returned in the same order when
searching. An R-tree ordering is unstable. This may be an important detail
if you desire deterministic results.
</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>
You can use the Spatial B-tree today using the 
<a href="https://github.com/tidwall/bgen">Bgen B-tree Generator</a> for C.
